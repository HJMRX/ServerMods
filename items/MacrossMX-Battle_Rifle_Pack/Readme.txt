Before I begin, credit to Frumorn for his autoM1A and autoSR25 mods which inspired
me to create this mod.

-Introduction-
This mod is created in order to create a separate M1A and SR25 so it does not 
conflict with other mods, specifically AssAssIn's Olympus mod.

-What this mod adds/change
This mod contains an SR-25, M1A, and SVDS that are modded to have full auto to emulate
their role as a Battle Rifle (AR-10, M14, AVDS) instead of a Designated Marksman Rifle.
In addition the M1A (M14) and SVDS (AVDS) have their rate of fire buffed up to 750 and 800 respectively,

-What it does not add/change
Aside from the addition of full auto and changes to the RoF all other stats are untouched.

-installation
Add these lines to your server.config.json
*note* If you are using AssAssIn's Olympus mod, be sure to install that mod after these mods
are installed or else it will conflict with the stock weapons:

			{
				"name": "AVDS",
				"author": "MacrossMX",
				"version": "1.0.0"
			},
			{
				"name": "AR10",
				"author": "MacrossMX",
				"version": "1.0.0"
			},
			{
				"name": "M14",
				"author": "MacrossMX",
				"version": "1.0.0"
			}

-Bugs
This mod is currently incompatible with AssAssIn's Olympus mod, so you cannot use 1000rnd magazines
on these rifles.

-Trivia
The SVDS is renamed to the AVDS as a way to comply with how Russia would designate this weapon had it
been created with a full auto setting:

Avtomat = Automatic
Vintovka = Rifle
Dragunova = Dragunov
Skladnoy = Folding (stock)
